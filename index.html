<p>Cats are obligate carnivores and love meat-based foods like chicken, turkey, fish, and beef. Wet food, especially with a meaty sauce or pate, is often their favorite due to its texture and flavor. Many cats enjoy fish, such as tuna or salmon, and some also like high-quality dry food. Treats like catnip or small pieces of cooked meat can also be a hit, appealing to their natural hunting instincts.</p>
